# EV Zone Mapping & Routing – Delhi

A geospatial modeling project that maps electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Delhi using **zone-based grid partitioning**. It includes functionality to **assign vehicles to the nearest station** based on their coordinates and **estimate traffic-aware sub-zones** in densely populated areas. Built with **Python, Pandas, and Folium** for visualization.

This traffic-aware EV infrastructure analysis tool extends the capabilities by incorporating real-world geospatial data to:
- 🗺️ Partition the city into zones
- 📍 Assign vehicles to the **nearest station** based on coordinates
- 🚦 Check **real-time traffic congestion** via TomTom Traffic API
- 🧭 Generate **optimal driving routes** using TomTom Routing API
- 🖼️ Render a **visual HTML map** with route and zone information
